The extended autoencoder model is a tensorflow-based neural network that was constructed to gain insights on the reaction mechanism of methane hydrate nucleation.
The model preprocesses incoming data, maps it to a latent space and then both reconstructs the input as well as predicts a committor based on the mapping on the latent space.
